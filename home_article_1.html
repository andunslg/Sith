			<h1>Introduction to Perception Analysis</h1>
            <div align="justify"><br>
            </div>
            <p>Perceptions are the experience which people gain about the world via the  sensory system [1]. Perception is a key step of the human perceptual process.  Followings are the steps belong to the human perceptual process,</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stimulus</strong> - </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These  are the inputs for the human perceptual process. These inputs are collected  from the human sensory system.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Transduction</strong> - </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Converting  the stimulus in to an electrical signal is transduction. These electrical  signals are generated in the human nerve system.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Neural Processing</strong> -</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The  electrical signals generated by the transduction are propagated through series  of interconnected neurons to the brain. The path obtained for the propagation  of the signal is dependent to the type of the signal. Auditory signal go  through one path, visual signals go through another path etc. The processing  happens between the propagation of the signal and at the brain is known as  neural processing. </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Perception</strong> -</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The  point where the human is consciously aware about the stimulus is known as the  perception. This happens after the neural processing.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Recognition</strong> - </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Categorizing  and Interpreting stimulus is known as the recognition. This happens inside the  human brain.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Action</strong> -</li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify">The  response given to the identified environment stimulus is known as the action.  This is the final step of human perpetual process.<br>
            </p>
            <p align="justify">The perception step, recognition step and the action step of the human  perceptual process are heavily dependent on the previous experience and the  knowledge of the human. Importantly those indicate the internal characteristics  of the human mind. For an example consider a situation where a person is  watching a movie. The liking about the movie is totally dependent to his  previous experiences. His comments and criticisms about the movie will be  aligning with his mindset. These comments and criticism provides a perfect  reflection of human mind.</p>
            <p align="justify">Careful identification and interpretation of human perceptions,  recognitions and actions can reveal human mind. That is the basic of perception  analysis. Basically perception analysis is identifying peoples mind by  analyzing the data related to perceptions. Within the past few decades researchers  have developed many mechanisms to do perception analysis. There have been many  motivations and advantages behind these research. All these motivations will be  discussed in the next sections.</p>
            <p align="justify">The most important thing in perception analysis is finding human  perceptions related data. In the past, people have developed explicit  mechanisms to collect perceptions related data. Surveys, questioners,  interviews and think aloud [2] are such mechanisms. When these mechanisms are  in action people have to participate explicitly to provide data related to  their perceptions. That participation can be answering to a Likert Scale [3]  based questioner, writing answers to questions and speaking etc.One of the  previous sections of this literature survey has comprehensively discussed the  surveying techniques, their advantages and weaknesses.</p>
            <p align="justify">The recent trend in collecting perceptions related data is using passive  mechanisms. Development of information technology sector was the main reason  behind this trend. In the current context, the regular life of a person has  been changed a lot with respect to the past. People who used to read books,  newspapers to explore the world, now use handheld gateways to access to the  internet. A mobile phone, a tablet or any other smart device allows them to  access diversified content all around the world. That was enabled by the  invention of World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989. But the earliest web; i.e. web 1.0  restricted content generation and sharing to site authors. With those  restrictions, only a specific sector including authors, journalists and critics  were given the chance to express themselves publicly. But the development of  technology has facilitated each and every person to express their thoughts  using media like blogs, social networks and video sharing sites such as  YouTube. Ultimately a regular person has been evolved to an active writer and a  viewer with the transition of web 1.0 to web 2.0. In web 2.0 the end users of  WWW actively participate in content generation which was dominated by server  administrators in web1.0. </p>
            <p align="justify">With the movement of content creation capability to general public,  people started to create content in different forms such as blog articles,  videos, tweets, Facebook status updates, comments etc. That crowdsourced  contents reflect various psychological aspects of a human being having such  sensations, opinions and attitudes. Also these content are available in public.  Thus researchers developed mechanisms to use these publicly available data in  perception analysis. Such perception analysis mechanisms are passive since  those data have been created for other purposes. Sentiment Analysis is the most  popular passive mechanism for perception analysis. The previous section on that  topic provides a comprehensive discussion on this.<br>
              Accurate analytics was the main advantage of the explicit mechanisms  which were used in the earlier stages. The main reason behind that accuracy was  the collected data were indented to highlight perception. Also these mechanisms  guaranteed the privacy of the participants. The main disadvantage of this is  the effort needed in the process. Passive mechanisms provide much effective and  effortless ways of perception analysis. But the accuracy and privacy of user  have some issues. </p>

<h3>Motivation behind Perception Analysis</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>Physiological Interests</h4>
<br>
<p align="justify">One of the first motivations of perception analysis is  physiological research. Physiologists wanted to understand behavior of the  mind. That interest provided the birth to this research area. There are many research done in this area. For an example,  Munmun, Scott and Michael from Microsoft Research have done a research one  human emotional status in social media [3]. They have analyzed the human  emotions related data in different angles. Those angles are like this,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Categorizing the emotions of people based on  their activation and valance</li>
  <li>Sharing frequency of the emotional status</li>
  <li>The socialness of  people</li>
  <li>The activity level of human in social media</li>
  <li>The behavior of criticism made by people </li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">By looking at  the above list, anyone can understand how compressively they have analyzed the  social media and the behavior of people. To do this kind of analytics of human  emotions, perception analysis on social media is mandatory.</p>
<h4>Simulating the Human  Mind</h4><br>
<p align="justify">Some researchers wanted to develop cognitive tools to simulate  the human mind inside the computer. &ldquo;HiTEC&rdquo; is such a cognitive tool which used  to simulate human computer interaction and reactions [4]. The researchers  propose this &ldquo;HiTEC&rdquo; cognitive tool as an alternative for human subject in user  interfaces testing. They have developed this cognitive tool by analyzing  perceptions and responses of human computer interactions.<br>
  Marc, Micheline and Koen from Ghent  University, Belgium have developed a computerized music analyzing platform  called &ldquo;IPEM Toolbox&rdquo; [5]. This toolbox is used to mimic the perceptual process  of human for music subjects.  They have  used the toolbox to categories and score music without using human subjects for  evaluations. For the development of tools box they have done enormous amount of  perception analysis. <br>
  Likewise to model human mind, sophisticated perception  analysis is mandatory. Thus researchers have positive influence for their  research in perception analysis.</p>
<h4>Sales and Marketing  Sector</h4>
<br><p align="justify">Sales and sector is driven mainly one the requirements of  users and customers. Their main focus is to supply what customer wants and  emphasis the importance of company&rsquo;s products to customers. To identify the  customer behavior and their needs, sales and marketing people uses many  workaround methods.  &ldquo;Rightwave&rdquo; is a  cloud service which provides marketing as a service [6]. They provide methods  to track customer&rsquo;s behavior in a company. Also &ldquo;Google Analytics&rdquo; provides web  based analytical methods to find details about viewers of websites [7]. <br>
  The requirement of understanding thoughts, feelings of customers  and users motivated the research in perception analysis. Because accurate  perception analysis can provide valuable data related to customers. The current  development of perception analysis has positively influenced in marketing and  sales. Marketers and product managers can align their products and services  according to trends and preferences of consumers through accessing perceptual  data which would impact positively in profit maximization. Those influences  provide more motivation to the research to find more and more effective and  accurate methods.</p>
<h4>Decision Making </h4>
<br><p align="justify">Individual or organizational level decision making  process can be supported with crowdsourced perception analytics results. Often,  people search through online product review sites such as GSMArena [8] before  purchasing a product. Their decision is heavily influenced with the reviews and  comments by the users who are already consuming the product. Organizational  decisions such as introducing a new product or a service are also affected by  perceptions of crowd regarding trends and their favors. Individual discussion  like purchasing, travelling destinations selection, educational pathway  selection can also be supported by perception analysis results.</p>
<h4>Managing Reputation </h4>
<br><p align="justify">Other major concern of individuals and organizations is improving  reputation. It is more effective to concern about social trends, opinions in  managing reputation. Those trends and opinions provide clues to work on to  maximize reputation. Individuals and organization can use methodologies like  surveys to obtain details about trends and opinions of the society. </p>
<h4>Usability and  Acceptance Checking</h4>
<br><p align="justify">Usability and acceptance checking is another major  motivation for perception analysis research. The current business domain is  more customer oriented, which mainly focuses on customer acceptance and  satisfaction. <br>
  User interface design  for software products is highly dependent on user&rsquo;s acceptance and their  comment on usability. Because of this importance, people have developed methods  like &ldquo;Think Aloud&rdquo; to get feed backs from users [9]. This method uses colleting  verbalization of thoughts came across the user&rsquo;s mind when they use the user  interface [2]. The collected data will be analyzed later to find important  results. Also researchers further improve these methods by tracking the eye  movement, tacking the cursor movement of user to find the acceptance of user [2].</p>
<h4>Real-time Feedback  analysis</h4>
<br><p align="justify">Human perceptions rapidly change when they are engaging in  activities like watching TV shows and movies, lectures, conferences etc. Being  aware of those rapidly changing perceptions is invaluable to the lecturer,  speaker, producer or the performer as a measure of success of their product and  to understand the desires of the audience. </p>
<p align="justify">The  real time analyses of user&rsquo;s perceptions are important for many parties and  they can use the result in many ways in maximizing their works. For an example  if there is a way to analyse perceptions in real time, presenters can adapt on  the requirement of audience [10]. For an example this concept was used in the  2012 presidential election in USA. Limited number of audience was given the  chance to give their rating to live presidential debate [11]. The analytical  data were published in both real-time and non-real-time. So debaters can align  their arguments and speech watching the real-time feedback. Another example  would be TV program production. They value the user&rsquo;s feedback to the content  they telecast. Focusing on that importance, researchers have developed  interactive TV concept to get users feedback. Some cable TV operators provide  mechanisms to viewer to rate TV programs. &ldquo;iTV&rdquo; is such an interactive TV  concept which allows user to give real-time feedback in many areas like  content, camera angle etc. [12].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to do Perception Analysis ?</h3>
<br/>
<p align="justify">If we think about the first focus of the process, we have to find data where people express their thoughts and opinions. From the ancient time people were readers and writers. So the first focused data category was text. People have used text to express their opinions in places like Twitter, Facebook, Blogs, Reviews in shopping sites etc. Those text were public most of the time.  So researchers developed ways to identify perception of the writer of that text content by processing those text. This process involved processing of natural language statements. This process has specially named as sentiment analysis. We have talked about that process much in this article also. But here we will highlight some drawbacks of this particular method where researchers have tried finding more ways to do perception analysis.<br>
The accuracy of understanding the perceptions of people using the text written by them is less. The reasons are existing sentiment analysis have problems in named entity recognition (what the person actually talking about). Also parsing sentences is difficult. (What are subject and the object of the sentence etc.) Identifying and analyzing sarcasms, tracking abbreviations, spellings and punctuations is bit complex. Also poor grammars of text make sentiment analysis even hard. Also the write-ups are relative to the culture of the people. Different sentence can mean different things in different cultures.<br>
Most of the time existing implementation can do only polarizing. That means they say the sentence is positive on the subject or negative or neutral on this subject. That is not sufficient to have a good understanding of perceptions.<br>
Other way of capturing perception is getting feedback using a questionnaire. Most of the time place where service offered, this methodology is used. A well organized questionnaire with Likert items is given to people to provide there feed backs. Collecting big number of such feedback can be used to do a good perception analysis. Regardless of the accuracy of this method, this makes trouble to people. Because they are forced sometimes to do this while this process takes much time. So this has some negatives.<br> 
Some people have used videos, voice to provide the feedbacks and their opinions. So researchers tried to analyses those videos, voice using AI, Image processing and Sound Processing. But that task also a painful hard task.<br>
There are other ways of capturing perceptions, opinions of people by observing them. By observing the visited sites, viewed videos we can understand the perceptions. But this method has some privacy issues also.<br>
Also there are many others out of the box ways to capture perception of people. Some researchers trying to develop a game kind of a thing where user have to organize some mixed set of pictures or objects. By classifying the organizing patterns researchers trying understand the opinion or the perception of the people. Also some researchers have tried to build a neural network to identify the sensations of cloth to its wearer. By identifying that sensation they are trying to understand the perceptions.<br>
</p>

<h3>What will be the future?</h3>
<br/>
<p align="justify">This literature review highlights that the perception analysis is a  broad area with multiple use cases in many domains. The perception analysis  started from active (direct) methods such as survey techniques and has been  evolved towards passive (indirect) methods such as sentiment analysis. All  these methods have inherent drawbacks which have been discussed in previous  sections. The current trends of perception analysis which focuses on overcoming  these drawbacks will be discussed as the future research direction of this  survey.  <br>
  The current research on perception analysis have following architectural  concerns,</p>
<ul>
  <li>crowdsourcing  the perception analysis process</li>
  <li>real-time  complex event processing</li>
  <li>efficient  data storage</li>
  <li>advanced  data visualizations</li>
</ul>
<h4>Crowdsourcing  the perception analysis process</h4>
<br/>
<p align="justify">One of the main  architectural concerns of current perception analysis research is to  crowdsource the perception analysis process. This requires people to actively  participate in the process of perception analysis by expressing their emotions,  thoughts, opinions etc.  Many research  have done to introduce new explicit perception capturing/sharing mechanisms,  replacing existing passive perception capturing mechanisms. The main objectives  behind these research are to achieve higher accuracy and validity in perception  analysis while guaranteeing privacy [15]. In addition to analytics there are  many psychological, health and social advantage of expressing/sharing emotions,  opinions and thoughts [16].<br>
  There are many  research and prototype level implementations done on the concept of explicit  perception sharing and crowdsourced perception analysis. &ldquo;Mobimood&rdquo; [15],  &ldquo;Aurora&rdquo; [16], &ldquo;Mappiness&rdquo; [13], &ldquo;Got a feeling&rdquo; [14] are such prototype mobile  applications which have been used to share emotion within a group of people. In  those applications, people can explicitly express their feelings using colours,  pictures and texts. People who use the application can view the perceptions and  feelings of the other people and give feedbacks, ideas, opinions on those  perceptions. <br>
  This explicit  perception sharing &amp;crowdosurced perception analysis concept has created a  network of perceptions. Some researchers have suggested social networks on top  of this concept. &ldquo;IRENE&rdquo; [17] and &ldquo;EmoSoNet&rdquo; [18] are such conceptual social  networks of emotions and perception sharing.<br>
  Crowsdsourced  perception analysis process has to be facilitated with perception capturing  mechanisms, where the users can convey their exact perceptions in a simplest  way with minimum clicks, readings and navigations. That objective is closely  related with psychometrics in which we quantify the psychological variables.  The GUI should support to convey perceptions with minimum effort. Facebook  &lsquo;like button&rsquo; is only single click, but it has an enormous value addition for  whole Facebook echo system. It enables expressing users&rsquo; positive feeling on  some content in a very easy manner and now it has become a part of users&rsquo;  lifestyle. The introduction of new mechanism for expressing feelings has to guarantee  that it will be a part of user&rsquo;s lives without being inconvenient because the  success of this kind of system mainly depends on how it attaches with users&rsquo;  lives and how extensively it is used.<br>
  The perception  capturing mechanisms also should be diversified in order to avoid restricting  perception sharing by the location, the tasks they are involving, hardware  limitations etc.</p>
<h4>Real-time  complex event processing</h4>
<br/>
<p align="justify">The future perception analysis process will be  highly dependent on crowdsourced perception data from unlimited end users. Thus  the rate of events generated by end user applications is extremely high and  there might have spikes in event stream which cannot be anticipated. The events  which are generated from users have to be categorized based on event generator  or the user, the action related with the event, event generating location etc.  for the convenience of data analysis. Some of the events are related with other  events and tracking those relations is significant. Thus capturing, processing,  and analysis of user generating events is one of the major concerns in  perception analysis. Crowdsourced perception analysis process  have to be concerned with real time complex  event processing programming model for large clusters of events that provide  consistency, efficient fault recovery, efficient query processing of real time  events and powerful integration with batch systems.</p>
<h4>Efficient Data Storage</h4>
<br/>
<p align="justify">In a  corwdsoruced perception analysis process, perception related data sets will be  collected in huge amounts, in various complex forms. Since this is a  crowdsourced system, amount of generated data will show an exponential growth  with the number of users. Also there will be very high data generating rates  and analysing the stored data either in real-time or as batch processes is  essential. Therefore traditional data analysing methodologies and database  management tools are not appropriate and the usage has to be limited for the  new system. In this kind of corwdsourced perception analysis approach, the data  from various media, many formats and types has to be analysed to give an  integrated analytical results, hence managing the heterogeneity of data is one  of the other concern. Due to these reasons the storage system related with  perception analysis process has to be coped with big data management and  storage mechanisms based on the programming models like Map-Reduce for large  scale analysis [19] [20], and distributed database with NO- SQL concepts [21].</p>
<h4>Advanced data visualizations</h4>
<br/>
Usability  of a perception analysis system heavily depends on how the analysed information  is visualized to the user. When perception analysis is used only for business  analytics, visualization was only limited for charts in web or especially  written software UIs. But with the beginning of using perception analysis for  personal tasks and with the start mobile internet era researchers have tried to  implement new kinds of visualization techniques to provide a more efficient  service via perception analysis. That remains as a major architectural concern  of current research.
