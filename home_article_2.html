			<h1>Crowdsourcing</h1>
            <br>
			<h3>What is crowdsourcing?</h3>
              <br>
            <p align="justify">According to the Oxford English dictionary crowdsourcing is obtaining  information or input into a particular task or project by enlisting the  services of a number of people, either paid or unpaid, typically via the  Internet. Even though it proclaims &ldquo;typically via the internet&rdquo;, there are many  other forms of crowdsourcing. Since this project utilizes internet for the  connectivity, the above definition is still valid.<br>
              Usually a crowdsourcing systems can be divided in to two categories; implicit  and explicit crowdsourcing systems [1]. Explicit category includes evaluating,  sharing and networking systems. In addition to those, there are explicit  crowdsourcing systems for building artifacts and task executions [1].Â  Evaluating systems allow users to do tasks  like rating, voting, tagging, etc. International movie database (IMDB) [2] is  an evaluating system where users can rate movies in a one-to-ten scale. By  doing that people enjoy benefits like movie recommendations, tracking watched  movies, etc. With crowdsourced ratings, site vendors can do different analytics  according to gender, age group, country, etc. Websites like YouTube[3] and  Flicker[4] are examples for crowdsourced sharing systems. All the content of  those web sites are added by users expecting to share with the community.  Social networking applications like Facebook[5] fall into networking  crowdsourced systems category. Open source software is a good example for  crowdsourcing which is used to create or improve artifacts. Amazon Mechanical Turk  [6] is a very popular crowdsourcing platform which facilitates users to  complete tasks and in return they might be paid. These tasks vary in a wide  range from simplest tasks such as surveys to complex tasks like analyzing  satellite images.<br>
              In addition to these explicit crowdsourcing systems there are many  situations where crowdsourcing happens implicitly. reCAPTCHA[7] is a perfect  example for this. It provides two distorted words to be identified and typed  correctly in order to proceed while completing a particular task in a web page.  Even though the main objective of a CAPTCHA puzzle is to reduce spam, it  improves the process of digitizing books by sending words that cannot be read  by computers to the web in the form of CAPTCHAs for humans to decipher.<br>
              The most important part of a crowdsourced system is to  motivate people for the crowdsourcing process. Usually people expect personal  benefits for the effort and time he/she sacrifices for the crowdsourcing  activity. These benefits can be either monetary or in any other  forms. Crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk pays money to people  who participate in their crowdsourcing activities while users tend to answers  the questions to increase their reputation score in Stack Overflow[8] which is  a technical forum site for programmers </p>
            <h3>The requirement for crowdsourcing</h3>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">This research mainly focuses on explicit perception sharing. Instead of  passive perception capturing and analysis techniques like sentiment analysis, this  platform allows people to explicitly share their thoughts and emotions. Usually  people are not interested to involve in such tasks sacrificing their effort,  time or money (users have to pay for things like network bandwidth). Thus the  proposed system must use crowdsourcing techniques to make people actively  participate in explicit perception sharing.<br>
              Many recent research have proven that crowdsourcing is very suitable for  human subject research. Since perception analysis deals with the human mind,  crowdsourcing is an ideal solution for this. When crowdsourcing was not popular,  many human subject researchers ended up generalizing of broad populations from  very few individuals [9]. Most of the time those individuals belonged to the  same or similar social groups. Crowdsourcing breaks this barrier and provides  access to a huge population of people who are interested in participating in  web-based or mobile based tasks at their own convenience [9]. Rapid development  of internet and other communication technologies has made this even more viable  [10].<br>
              There are several recent research which attempted to use crowdsourcing  in some phases of the perception analyze process. Even Though those cannot be  directly applied for the proposed system there are many lessons which can be  learnt from them. Surveys are one of the primitive methods of capturing  perceptions. A research on the viability of crowdsourcing for survey research  has concluded that the quality of crowdsourced data is as good and diverse [11].  Other than surveys there are many other crowdsourced perception capturing  systems available for web. OpinionLab [12], Kampyle[13] and Ideascale[14] are  some examples to them. But functionality of all these systems is limited to  capturing perceptions for the content of the web sites which they have been integrated. <br>
              Development of smart phone technologies has made crowdsourcing even more  applicable to various situations. Research have been conducted to measure the  effectiveness of doing surveys through smartphones [15]. The primary advantage  of smart phone surveys is that those can be tailored into the situation of the  user. As an example if the user is in a theater, questions which ask whether he  is enjoying the movie can be pushed into his smartphone. There are three kinds  of approaches; via mobile browsers, as separate apps and web apps which appear  as native apps[16].Voting is an another area for which mobile crowdsourcing can  be effectively applied. It has been identified that the mobile voting systems succeed  in providing enhanced effectiveness in voting for smartphone owners, compared  to the commonly used voting systems today [17]. Ortag&amp;Huang[18] have tried  to collect location-based emotions relevant for pedestrian navigation via  mobile crowdsourcing. By doing that they could aggregate mental maps (a  person&rsquo;s subjective image of the world) of many people to provide guideline or  tips for pedestrian navigation. They also plan to store the crowdsourced  emotional data in an open database which allows its use for various purposes by  everyone. <br>
              Crowdsourcing has been also used for analytical purposes. OPTIMISM [19]  which is an opinion mining system for Portuguese politics have used  crowdsourcing to determine which entities of a complex opinion article are mentioned  in a positive or negative way. Templeton, Fleischmann, and Boyd-Graber have  used crowdsourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk to map sentiments of text into a  one-to-five scale [20]. In addition to these pure crowdsourced analyzers, there are  hybrid approaches such as systems which use crowdsourcing to train machine  learning systems for sentiment analysis [21].</p>
            <h3>Challenges in crowdsourcing</h3>
            <br>
            <p align="justify">The key challenge for crowdsourced systems is to persuade users for the  process. Social networking sites such as Facebook [5] and Twitter [22] which  have millions of users have drawn most of their users by word of mouth.  Spreading word of mouth is happened through a range of media that potential  users respond to. There have been only a little of a direct influence from the  owners, administrators or designers of these sites [23]. Such kind of  situations in which broadcasting and crowdsourcing is merged are referred as  crowdcasting [23]. Since a perception analyzing system is required to have a  very large subject pool to function correctly, this kind of approach is very  suitable for that.<br>
              Another important challenge in crowdsourcing approaches is to protect  the privacy of users. Some users hesitate to participate in crowdsourcing  programs because of the privacy issues. At the same time some users expect to  publish their services to the public for various reasons like improving the  reputation. Thus when designing a crowdsourced system, public and private data  has to be identified correctly and it is important to let the users to  customize their privacy settings.<br>
              Tracking bad behaviors is very critical for maintaining the quality of  data collected. Bad behaviors contain unexpected user actions like spamming,  fake inputs, manipulating the system, etc. General and system specific  precautions have to be taken to prevent those. When designing a crowdsourced  system ethical and legal considerations have to be thoroughly considered since  such systems deals with humans and their behaviors. As an example if we store  user&rsquo;s locations and those are not publicly visible we have legal obligations  to protect those data. Also it is unethical to track user behavior without  their knowledge. <br>
              In any kind of a crowdsourcing system it is important to know the demographic  makeup of the users. Researchers can better do their work if they understand  the sampling bias of the population participating in their studies [9]. As with  demographics, people&rsquo;s motivations for participating should be researched  separately to get a better understanding. When designing a crowdsourcing system  it has to be correctly identified the knowledge and skills of the target users.  Otherwise users may hesitate to use the system or the quality of the data  gathered will become low.<br>
              As previously discussed mobile crowdsourcing is getting popular and it  is very suitable for perception analysis, but there are challenges which are  specific for mobile crowdsourcing. Unlike desktop computers smart phones run on  battery power. Its network connectivity is expensive than LAN networks unless  it is connected to a Wi-Fi network. Also protecting privacy is also important  because since mobile phones are very connected to user&rsquo;s lives they have many  information which can affect the user&rsquo;s personal life. So a user would not be  interested in participating in mobile phone sensing, unless it receives a  satisfying reward to compensate its resource consumption and potential privacy  breach [24]. This reward can be money, information, entertainment or anything  which will be appreciated by the user. Another problem of mobile phone based  crowdsourcing systems is various inaccuracies. As an example GSM network based  positioning, with city- and district-level tracking, may not give accurate  enough location. It is, for example, not accurate enough to distinguish between  home and the shop nearby, or office and the lunch cafe [25]. Human factors also  have to be considered when designing mobile phone based systems. While mobile  phone technology is increasingly familiar to people in the developed world, not  all users are comfortable or familiar with smartphones. Many mobile phone  subscribers only use the most basic functionality and simple phones [25]. So  when designing a perception analysis system this type of people has to be taken  in to the account too. When doing smartphone based researches it is always  assumed that the user carries the phone with him always. But it some situations  it may left behind by choice or accident. So that detecting that kind of  situations is essential to maintain the accuracy. <br>
              Also it has to take into account that people are not equally capable of  participating in all situations. If the user is actually mobile at the time of  a sample, he or she may have extremely limited attention and cognitive resources  [26]. Even when not mobile, it may be awkward to fill out a questionnaire in a  social situation. In these cases, the answering may either be postponed to a  later time, with a decrease in accuracy, or not be done at all. So system is  has to be designed in such a way that it will not interfere his life but assist  his life style.			</p>
